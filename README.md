## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the
[Form Validation in React](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-validate-forms-in-react)
In this project, I will create a functional and reusable form using
the popular react-hook-form library in combination with Tailwind CSS for
styling.

The repository contains the complete source code for the form, including the
Input component and validation configurations. It also includes the necessary
dependencies and configuration files to get started with the form validation in
your own React projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project in your local development environment, follow
these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QQ07/form-validation.git
```

2. Open the cloned folder in your preferred code editor, install the required
   dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You are now ready to go!
